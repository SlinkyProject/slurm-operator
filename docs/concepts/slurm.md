# Slurm

> [Slurm] is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster
> management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters. Slurm
> requires no kernel modifications for its operation and is relatively
> self-contained. As a cluster workload manager, Slurm has three key functions.
> First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources
> (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work.
> Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work
> (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally, it
> arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.
> Optional plugins can be used for accounting, advanced reservation, gang
> scheduling (time sharing for parallel jobs), backfill scheduling, topology
> optimized resource selection, resource limits by user or bank account, and
> sophisticated multifactor job prioritization algorithms.
